# Observability-driven Hexagonal Architecture in TypeScript

This is a small example implementation to accompany a talk of the same name I originally gave at a [TampereJS](https://tamperejs.github.io/) meetup on 4.4.2024. The public slides are found in the repository root: [Observability-driven hexagonal architecture in TypeScript [public].pdf](/Observability-driven_hexagonal_architecture_in_TypeScript_public.pdf)
